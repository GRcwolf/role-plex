#+title: Plex Role
#+author: Chris Wolf <chris@chriswolf.ch>

This in an ansible role that installs a plex media server.

** Limitations
This role simply installs the plex debian package.
It can therefore only be used on debian based systems.

** Configuration
The configurations is pretty simple as the role basically only installs a debian package.

| Name              | Default | Description                                                           |
|-------------------+---------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| plex_version      |         | The version of plex, that will be installed                           |
| plex_architecture | amd64   | Defines for which architecture, the plex package should be downloaded |

/Note that plex versions have a hash at the end. This needs to be included in the version varaible./

** Variables
The role contains a varaible that isn't meant to be changed, as this is most likely not necessary.
If you want to change it, you can.
